# Data-Cleaning-Analysis-Script-Python-Pandas-
This Python script uses Pandas to automate data cleaning. It loads a messy sales dataset, then cleans and transforms it by fixing inconsistent text, handling missing values, and correcting data types (e.g., '$' prices). It then calculates key insights like total revenue and exports the final, clean data to a new CSV.
